# Runar's Portfolio


Runar’s Portfolio is a project from Noroff where we learn how to create a portfolio site. It has later been updated to work as my portfolio page in general to show off what I have be making.

## Description

The task was very flexible in terms of design and execution. The assignment asked us to showcase three of our previous projects on a webpage. This included creating three cards with text and images for each project.
I wanted to create a portfolio that stands out from the crowd, so I came up with the idea of making a parody of Google’s search engine. Instead of displaying search results, my "Google" showcases my past projects. I asked the teacher if it was okay to include more than three projects, and they approved.
With that green light, I started building my Google parody page for my portfolio. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and think it turned out both fun and cool. Now, I just have to cross my fingers that the teacher feels the same way!

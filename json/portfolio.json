        "description": "<p>Square Eyes was our first assignment at Noroff. We were given three options to build a website from, and I chose the streaming site Square Eyes. We were provided with the logo and clear guidelines on how the site should be designed. As a result, I mainly adapted the logo in terms of colours. I drew inspiration from well-known streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc.</p><p>Square Eyes is primarily built using only HTML and CSS, as these were the main focus of the assignment. I used just a bit of JavaScript to make the carousel function properly. Despite being just a mock-up site focused on design, it works well and offers good user functionality.</p>",

For example, we were not allowed to use JavaScriptâ€”only HTML and CSS. The design needed to be child-friendly but not overly childish. The task described a museum for older children, so I aimed for a design that could be fun for kids. I created Professor Kaos, a character I drew myself, and incorporated into various parts of the site.</p><p>I also designed the logo, which features a test tube cleverly used as both the 'I' and 'U' in the name.</p>",
